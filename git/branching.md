## Overview

As a developer since 2008, I’ve witnessed the evolution of version control systems firsthand. Starting with SVN and eventually transitioning to Git, I’ve seen how these tools have become indispensable in our daily workflows. Let me share a detailed branching strategy that has proven effective in managing codebases, ensuring stability, and facilitating collaboration.

---

## Main Branches

### main (or master) Branch

- **The production-ready code.**
- **Only contains thoroughly tested and stable code.**
- **Direct commits are restricted; only allowed through pull requests (PRs) after code review and approval.**

### develop Branch

- **The latest codebase reflecting the current state of development.**
- **All features and fixes are integrated into this branch before being merged into main.**
- **Serves as a base for all new feature branches.**

---

## Supporting Branches

### Feature Branches

- **Naming Convention:** `feature/<feature-name>`
- **Created from:** `develop`
- **Purpose:** For developing new features or enhancements.
- **Merging:** Once complete and tested, merge back into `develop`.

### Bugfix Branches

- **Naming Convention:** `bugfix/<issue-id>`
- **Created from:** `develop` (or `release` if the fix is for an upcoming release)
- **Purpose:** For fixing bugs identified during development.
- **Merging:** Merge back into `develop` (or `release` if applicable) once fixed.

### Release Branches

- **Naming Convention:** `release/<version-number>`
- **Created from:** `develop`
- **Purpose:** To prepare for a new production release.
- **Activities:** Final testing, bug fixing, and preparing release notes.
- **Merging:** Merge into both `main` and `develop` once ready.

### Hotfix Branches

- **Naming Convention:** `hotfix/<issue-id>`
- **Created from:** `main`
- **Purpose:** For urgent fixes that need to go directly into production.
- **Merging:** Merge into both `main` and `develop` once applied.

### Experiment Branches

- **Naming Convention:** `experiment/<experiment-name>`
- **Created from:** `develop`
- **Purpose:** For conducting experiments or prototyping new features without affecting the main development flow.
- **Merging:** Merge back into `develop` if the experiment proves successful or discard if not.

### Testing Branches
- **Naming Convention:** `test/<test-name>`
- **Created from:** `develop`
- **Purpose:** For isolating and testing specific changes or bug fixes.
- **Merging:** Merge back into `develop` once testing is complete.

## Branch Workflow

### Feature Development

1. Create a branch from `develop` using `feature/<feature-name>`.
2. Implement the feature, commit changes, and push the branch to the repository.
3. Open a pull request to merge the feature branch into `develop`.
4. Conduct code reviews, perform necessary tests, and merge the changes into `develop`.

### Bug Fixing

1. Create a branch from `develop` using `bugfix/<issue-id>`.
2. Fix the bug, commit changes, and push the branch.
3. Open a pull request to merge the bugfix branch into `develop`.
4. After reviews and tests, merge the changes into `develop`.

### Release Preparation

1. Create a branch from `develop` using `release/<version-number>`.
2. Perform final testing, fix any last-minute bugs, and update documentation.
3. Merge the release branch into both `main` and `develop` once ready.

### Hotfixes

1. Create a branch from `main` using `hotfix/<issue-id>`.
2. Apply the fix, commit changes, and push the branch.
3. Open a pull request to merge the hotfix branch into `main`.
4. Merge changes into `develop` to include the fix in ongoing development.

### Experimentation

1. Create a branch from `develop` using `experiment/<experiment-name>`.
2. Conduct experiments or prototype new features, commit changes, and push the branch.
3. Evaluate the results of the experiment.
4. If the experiment is successful, merge the branch back into `develop`. Otherwise, discard the branch.

### Testing

1. Create a branch from `develop` using `test/<test-name>`.
2. Isolate and test specific changes or bug fixes, commit changes, and push the branch.
3. Verify the correctness of the changes or fixes.
4. If issues are encountered during testing, create a GitHub issue to track and address them.
5. Merge the branch back into `develop` once testing is complete.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Merges:** Merge `develop` into feature branches regularly to stay updated and avoid integration issues.
2. **Code Reviews:** Conduct mandatory code reviews before merging any branch to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
3. **Automated Testing:** Implement continuous integration with automated testing to catch issues early and maintain code quality.
4. **Documentation:** Keep all changes well-documented, including comments in code, update logs, and comprehensive commit messages.

By following these guidelines, your branching strategy will contribute to a well-organized, stable, and collaborative codebase.
